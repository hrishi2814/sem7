### **Q: Explain in brief computer forensic services. Write the applications of digital forensics in military.**

#### **1. Computer Forensic Services**

Computer forensic services encompass the professional activities performed by forensic experts to identify, preserve, analyze, and present digital evidence. These services are utilized by law enforcement, legal firms, and corporations.

**Key Services Include:**

  * **Data Acquisition & Preservation:** Creating exact, bit-for-bit copies (**Forensic Images**) of hard drives, mobile devices, and cloud storage to ensure evidence integrity.
  * **Data Recovery:** Retrieving intentionaly deleted, formatted, or corrupted files using specialized carving techniques.
  * **Forensic Analysis:** examining the file system, registry, and artifacts to reconstruct user activities and timelines.
  * **Malware Analysis:** Reverse-engineering malicious software to understand its origin, payload, and impact.
  * **Expert Witness Testimony:** Presenting complex technical findings in a court of law in a simplified manner.
  * **Mobile & Network Forensics:** Extracting data from smartphones (call logs, GPS) and analyzing network traffic (packet capture) for intrusion detection.

#### **2. Applications of Digital Forensics in Military**

In the military sector, digital forensics is often referred to as **DOMEX (Document and Media Exploitation)**. It plays a critical role in national security and information warfare.

**Key Applications:**

  * **Intelligence Gathering (Intel):**
      * Extracting data from captured enemy devices (laptops, phones, drones) to reveal future plans, troop locations, or communication networks.
  * **Counter-Terrorism:**
      * Analyzing encrypted communications and financial logs to trace funding sources and recruitment networks of terrorist organizations.
  * **Cyber Warfare & Defense:**
      * Investigating state-sponsored cyberattacks to determine the **Attribution** (source) and methodology of the attack.
  * **Insider Threat Detection:**
      * Monitoring internal networks to detect espionage or unauthorized leakage of classified military secrets.
  * **Battlefield Forensics:**
      * Rapid on-site analysis of digital media found in combat zones to gain immediate tactical advantages (Real-time Intel).

#### **4. Key Technical Keywords**

  * **DOMEX (Document and Media Exploitation):** The processing of captured physical documents and digital media to generate intelligence.
  * **Triage:** The process of quickly prioritizing evidence to determine which devices contain the most critical information.
  * **Attribution:** The science of identifying the specific actor or group responsible for a cyber intrusion.
  * **Cryptanalysis:** The study of analyzing information systems to breach cryptographic security systems (cracking encryption).
