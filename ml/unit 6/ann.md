**Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are **computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain**. They consist of interconnected processing units called **artificial neurons**, which work together to learn patterns and relationships from data.

In an ANN, each neuron receives input signals, multiplies them by **weights**, adds a **bias**, and passes the result through an **activation function** to produce an output. Neurons are arranged in layers: an **input layer** that receives data, one or more **hidden layers** that perform feature extraction and learning, and an **output layer** that generates predictions.

ANNs learn by adjusting weights and biases using a learning process called **training**, typically based on **backpropagation** and **gradient descent**, where the error between predicted and actual output is minimized.

Artificial Neural Networks are widely used in applications such as **image and speech recognition, natural language processing, medical diagnosis, and pattern recognition**, due to their ability to model complex and non-linear relationships.

**In summary**, ANNs are powerful machine learning models that mimic biological neural systems to automatically learn from data and make intelligent decisions.
