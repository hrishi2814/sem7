### Role of IOTA in the Context of IoT

**IOTA** is a distributed ledger technology specifically designed to support the **Internet of Things (IoT)** ecosystem, where millions of devices need to communicate, exchange data, and make payments **securely, quickly, and without transaction fees**.

---

## What is IOTA?

IOTA is a **distributed ledger** that uses a structure called the **Tangle** instead of a traditional blockchain.  
The Tangle is a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** where transactions are linked directly to each other.

## Why Blockchain is Not Ideal for IoT

IoT systems face challenges such as:

- Massive number of devices
    
- Very small transactions (micro or nano payments)
    
- Limited device power and computation
    
- Need for real-time communication
    

Traditional blockchains struggle due to **fees, scalability limits, and mining costs**.

## Role of IOTA in IoT

### 1. Feeless Microtransactions

- IOTA has **zero transaction fees**.
    
- Devices can exchange tiny values or data without cost.
    
- Ideal for **machine-to-machine (M2M) payments**.
    

Example:  
A smart electric vehicle paying a charging station per second of charging.

---

### 2. High Scalability

- As more devices join the network, performance **improves instead of degrading**.
    
- Each new transaction validates two previous ones.
    

---

### 3. Lightweight Consensus

- No mining required.
    
- Low computational and energy requirements.
    
- Suitable for **low-power IoT devices**.
    

---

### 4. Data Integrity and Security

- Data sent by IoT devices can be stored on the Tangle.
    
- Ensures **tamper-proof and verifiable data**.
    
- Prevents spoofing and unauthorized modifications.
    

---

### 5. Decentralized Device Communication

- Devices can interact directly without intermediaries.
    
- Improves reliability and reduces single points of failure.
    

---

### 6. Identity and Access Management

- IOTA supports **decentralized identities** for devices.
    
- Helps authenticate devices and control access securely.
