### Types of Blockchain

Blockchains can be classified based on **access control, governance, and usage**. The main types are **Public, Private, Consortium, and Hybrid blockchains**.

---

## 1. Public Blockchain

### Definition

A **public blockchain** is an **open and permissionless** blockchain where **anyone can join**, read data, send transactions, and participate in consensus.

### Features

- Fully decentralized
    
- Transparent ledger
    
- High security through consensus mechanisms
    
- No central authority
    

### Consensus Mechanisms

- Proof of Work (PoW)
    
- Proof of Stake (PoS)
    

### Examples

- Bitcoin
    
- Ethereum
    

### Advantages

- Trustless environment
    
- Censorship resistant
    

### Disadvantages

- Low scalability
    
- High energy consumption
    
- Limited privacy

## 2. Private Blockchain

### Definition

A **private blockchain** is a **permissioned network** controlled by a **single organization**.

### Features

- Restricted access
    
- Centralized governance
    
- High transaction speed
    
- Better privacy
    

### Consensus Mechanisms

- RAFT
    
- PBFT
    

### Examples

- Hyperledger Fabric (private deployments)
    
- Multichain
    

### Advantages

- High performance
    
- Easy governance
    
- Data confidentiality
    

### Disadvantages

- Reduced decentralization
    
- Requires trust in the controlling entity

## 3. Consortium Blockchain

### Definition

A **consortium blockchain** is a **permissioned blockchain** governed by **multiple organizations** instead of a single entity.

### Features

- Shared control among organizations
    
- More decentralized than private blockchains
    
- Restricted access
    

### Consensus Mechanisms

- PBFT
    
- RAFT
    

### Examples

- R3 Corda
    
- Hyperledger Fabric (consortium setup)
    

### Advantages

- Balanced decentralization and control
    
- Suitable for inter-organizational collaboration
    

### Disadvantages

- Complex governance
    
- Limited openness
    

---

## 4. Hybrid Blockchain

### Definition

A **hybrid blockchain** combines features of **public and private blockchains**.

### Features

- Some data is public, some private
    
- Controlled access with public verification
    
- Flexible architecture
    

### Examples

- Dragonchain
    
- XinFin
    

### Advantages

- Better privacy with transparency
    
- Customizable access
    

### Disadvantages

- Complex implementation
    
- Not fully decentralized

## Summary Table

|Type|Access|Control|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Public|Open|No single owner|Bitcoin|
|Private|Restricted|Single organization|Hyperledger Fabric|
|Consortium|Restricted|Multiple organizations|Corda|
|Hybrid|Partial|Mixed|Dragonchain|

## Conclusion

Different blockchain types serve different needs. **Public blockchains** focus on decentralization, while **private and consortium blockchains** focus on efficiency and privacy. **Hybrid blockchains** offer a balance between both.

This is a **perfect 4–6 mark exam answer**. If you want it compressed to **2–3 marks**, tell me.
