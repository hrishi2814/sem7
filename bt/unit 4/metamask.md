## MetaMask (detailed explanation)

### Definition

**MetaMask** is a **non-custodial crypto wallet** and **Web3 gateway** that allows users to **store, send, receive cryptocurrencies**, manage **private keys**, and **interact with decentralized applications (dApps)** on Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.

It works as a **browser extension** and **mobile app**.

---

## Why MetaMask is Important

Before MetaMask, users needed to manually manage keys and nodes.  
MetaMask simplifies blockchain interaction by acting as a **bridge between users and dApps**.

---

## How MetaMask Works

### 1. Wallet and Key Management

- Generates and stores **private keys locally** on the user’s device
    
- Uses a **seed phrase (12/24 words)** for recovery
    
- User has full control of funds (non-custodial)
    

---

### 2. Account Management

- Supports multiple accounts under one seed phrase
    
- Each account has a unique public address
    

---

### 3. Transaction Signing

- When a dApp requests a transaction:
    
    - MetaMask shows transaction details
        
    - User approves or rejects
        
- Transactions are **signed locally** using the private key
    

---

### 4. Network Support

Supports:

- Ethereum Mainnet
    
- Testnets (Sepolia, Goerli)
    
- Custom EVM chains like:
    
    - Polygon
        
    - BNB Chain
        
    - Arbitrum
        

Users can manually add networks using RPC details.

### 5. dApp Interaction

- Injects a Web3 provider into the browser
    
- Allows dApps to:
    
    - Read wallet address
        
    - Request signatures
        
    - Execute smart contract calls
        

Example:  
Using MetaMask to connect to Uniswap or OpenSea.

## MetaMask vs Traditional Wallet

|Aspect|MetaMask|Bank Wallet|
|---|---|---|
|Custody|User-owned|Bank-owned|
|Access|Decentralized|Centralized|
|Transparency|High|Low|
|Control|Full|Limited|
