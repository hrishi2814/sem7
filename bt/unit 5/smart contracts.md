### Smart Contracts: Purpose and Types

---

## Definition of Smart Contract

A **smart contract** is a **self-executing computer program** stored on a blockchain that **automatically enforces and executes the terms of an agreement** when predefined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries.

---

## Purpose of Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are used to:

1. **Automate Agreements**
    
    - Execute transactions automatically when conditions are satisfied.
        
2. **Eliminate Intermediaries**
    
    - Removes banks, lawyers, or brokers, reducing cost and delay.
        
3. **Ensure Trust and Transparency**
    
    - Contract logic is visible and verifiable on the blockchain.
        
4. **Improve Security**
    
    - Cryptographically secured and tamper-proof.
        
5. **Increase Efficiency**
    
    - Faster execution and reduced manual errors.
        
6. **Enable Decentralized Applications (dApps)**
    
    - Form the backbone of DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web3 apps.
