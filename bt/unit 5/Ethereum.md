## Ethereum

### Definition

**Ethereum** is an **open-source, decentralized blockchain platform** that enables developers to build and deploy **smart contracts** and **decentralized applications (dApps)** without relying on a central authority. It was proposed by **Vitalik Buterin** in 2013 and launched in **2015**.

---

## Core Idea of Ethereum

Bitcoin was designed mainly as digital money.  
Ethereum extends blockchain functionality by introducing **programmable logic** on the blockchain through **smart contracts**.

---

## Key Components of Ethereum

### 1. Ether (ETH)

- Native cryptocurrency of Ethereum
    
- Used to pay **gas fees** for transactions and smart contract execution
    
- Acts as an incentive for validators
    

---

### 2. Smart Contracts

- Self-executing programs stored on the blockchain
    
- Automatically run when predefined conditions are met
    
- Written mainly in **Solidity**
    

Example:  
A smart contract that releases payment automatically when goods are delivered.

---

### 3. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

- A global decentralized computation engine
    
- Executes smart contracts uniformly across all Ethereum nodes
    
- Ensures deterministic execution
    

---

### 4. Gas Mechanism

- Gas measures the computational effort required for operations
    
- Prevents spam and infinite loops
    
- Users pay gas fees in ETH
    

---

## Consensus Mechanism

- Ethereum initially used **Proof of Work (PoW)**
    
- Now uses **Proof of Stake (PoS)** after _The Merge_
    
- Validators stake ETH to propose and validate blocks

## Features of Ethereum

- Decentralized and trustless
    
- Programmable blockchain
    
- Supports token creation (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155)
    
- Large developer ecosystem
    

---

## Applications of Ethereum

- Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
    
- Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
    
- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)
    
- Gaming and metaverse applications
    
- Supply chain and identity solutions
    

---

## Advantages

- Highly flexible and programmable
    
- Strong network effects and community
    
- Widely adopted standards
    

---

## Limitations

- Scalability challenges
    
- High gas fees during congestion
    
- Smart contract security risks
    

---

## Conclusion

Ethereum is more than a cryptocurrency; it is a **decentralized global platform for programmable blockchain applications**. By enabling smart contracts and dApps, Ethereum has become the foundation for **Web3, DeFi, and NFTs**, making it one of the most influential blockchain technologies.
